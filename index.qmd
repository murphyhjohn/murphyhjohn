# Welcome to my website!

Hi, I'm Murphy!

I am a first-year PhD student in Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of Georgia. Prior to UGA, I studied mathematics and statistics at the University of New Mexico.

I created this website and blog as a place to store and share my academic materials as well as personal interests. In my free time, I enjoy yoga, running, rock climbing, and hiking. When I visit home, my hiking adventures are joined by my family's golden retriever, Frankie!
