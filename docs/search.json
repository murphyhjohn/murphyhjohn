I chose the University of Georgia’s Epidemiology and Biostatistics PhD program and am currently starting my first year.\nThe purpose of this post is to document and share my experiences with deciding to pursue my PhD, actually applying, being accepted (and rejected), and choosing the best fit. I’ve broken this into three parts. Part 1: Getting Started gives you a place to, well, start. Part 2: The Actual Application, goes into detail the standard required materials you will need to prepare for your application. In Part 3: After You Hit Submit, I talk about my personal experience with the decision process, including acceptance and offer letters, interviews, and visit days."

    "text": "Part 1: Getting Started\n\n1.1 Identifying Programs\nIf you’re anything like me, you are feeling confident in your decision to apply to graduate school, but you have no idea where to start. This section gives a few suggestions on identifying programs that interest you and narrowing down it down to a solid list of schools to apply to.\n\nTalk to people!!!\n\nThis is probably the most important piece of advice that I can give you. Reach out your academic advisor, your faculty mentor, your internship supervisor, even a stranger whose research you found interesting. Yes seriously, reach out to strangers. Here’s why.\nAfter my summer REU had concluded and I was firmly set on the idea of applying to PhD programs, I got to work looking up the best institutions, and research groups. Given my background and interests, it seemed natural to apply to statistics programs. I identified a school with a very prestigious (a word to be discussed later) stats program, a PI, and a lab group that I wanted to learn more about. I emailed one of the students in the group expressing my interest and asked if he’d be willing to chat with me sometime. Within 5 minutes he ecstatically replied that he’d be happy to talk (sidenote: If you are nervous, like I was, about reaching out to people in academia, just know that the majority love to talk about their work and experiences. More likely than not, they will take it as a compliment that you are interested in learning from them). One of the things we talked about were my research interests. He noticed a common theme; I was exclusively drawn to statistical applications to public health research. He suggested that, given what I had shared with him, I also look into programs specifically for biostatistics. At the time, I had never heard of biostatistics, much less ever thought about applying to graduate program in the field. Had I not reached out to this person and asked to have a conversation, I likely would not be where I am today.\nThis may be a unique story, but what I am trying to say is that you can only benefit from talking to people who have been where you are. Your academic advisors and professors are great resources to reach out to. In my experience, each person contributes a piece (or pieces) of advice that will ultimately help you get to where you are going. But you don’t know what you don’t know if you don’t ask! :)\n\nFind a list of institutions that have your program of interest and browse.\n\nYou might have a few schools in mind but there’s likely a lot of places that offer your degree of interest that you may not have thought of. A comprehensive list of stats and biostats grad programs can be found here. I went through this list and made note of schools that sounded intriguing to me in some way. Then I did a deeper search into those schools to see if they had the other qualities that I was looking for (see below).\n\nMake sure that there is faculty doing work you are interested in.\n\nIf you have made the decision to pursue a PhD (a research extensive degree), you should think about a few areas of research that you might want to pursue. I am not implying that you should have a project proposal in your back pocket by the time you apply, in fact I think it is good to be open minded, but you should have an idea of what interests you. In your search, you may also come across exciting areas of work that you hadn’t previously thought about. This being said, make sure that all of the schools you apply to have multiple faculty members (emphasis on multiple; one person may not have room in their lab, may move, etc.) that you can see yourself working with.\n\nEnsure that the coursework fits your goals.\n\nThis is actually something I didn’t prioritize in my initial search for programs that I wish I did. In the fields of statistics and biostatistics, research is typically either theoretical (coming up with new methods) or applicable (applying existing methods to a real-world issue). I found that programs lean toward one or the other in their coursework. I am more drawn to the application realm of research. I know that I could take the more theoretical coursework (and in most programs you are required to take some amount of theoretical coursework), but it ultimately wouldn’t prepare me for my end goal as well as coursework focused on applications would. And vice versa if I were more interested in theory.\n\nDon’t focus too much on ranking.\n\nThis is just my opinion. When discussing this with a professor, they shared the advice, “if you’re good, you’re good”. Your PhD experience will be what YOU make of it. It is more important to put yourself in a program where you enjoy the coursework, research opportunities, and people rather than one that is ‘prestigious’.\n\nLocation is not everything, but it is important.\n\nFive years of your life is a substantial chunk of time. Think about where you want to spend it. Or at least where you DON’T want to spend it. If you hate the snow, don’t exclusively apply to schools in the northeast. If city life isn’t your cup of tea, check out schools that are in smaller college towns. For each program that you are considering, ask yourself if you will be able to live, and thrive, in that location. In order to focus on your professional life, you must put yourself in an environment where you are happy.\n\nParticipate in prospective student programs.\n\nSome departments offer a prospective student program for you to learn more about them and determine if THEY are a good fit for YOU. Two schools that I was considering offered versions of this, both included some form of correspondence with a current student in the department. One was a great experience and made me very excited to apply. The other raised a few red flags and contributed to my later decision to not apply there.\n\nReach out to professors at the schools you are considering.\n\nI emailed at least one professor who I was interested in at each of the schools that I applied to. I received responses to all of the emails that I sent and arranged a meeting with most. All of the meetings were very pleasant and made me feel confident in my decision to apply to the school. This was a great way to learn the finer details of each faculty member’s lab, their work, and the student-faculty dynamics of the program. I would recommend doing this but you’re not hurting your application if you choose not to.\nIf you choose to, when you find a professor whose work interests you, read a few of their recent publications and write them an email explaining your interest in their work and the program. Ask if they are willing to arrange a time to meet with you to discuss further. When a meeting is arranged, make sure that you prepare plenty of questions. But also remember that professors are just people and there is no need to be nervous or afraid of them. Just focus on having a conversation.\n\nDon’t ignore red flags.\n\nThis is pretty self explanatory but for example, if you are talking with faculty or current students and they raise a topic that is concerning to you, do not ignore it. If it is bothering you, ask about it. In my opinion, a good program will be prepared to answer your questions with transparency."

    "text": "1.2 How many programs should you apply to?\nI applied to seven programs, all being PhD. Five were Biostatistics, one (the school that I chose) was Epidemiology & Biostatistics, and one was Statistics. Four were top-ten programs in their respective fields.\nI talked this over with an advisor and she believed that, based on my resume, anywhere from 5-9 programs was a good number for me. I encourage you to talk to your mentors and to be honest with yourself. If you’re looking at PhD programs, consider applying to a master’s program as well, even if it’s just for peace-of-mind. Also, don’t go broke applying to grad school. Application fees are expensive and at the end of the day, you’re only saying yes to one school."
